A Federated Proxy for the HDR UK Cohort Discovery Tool's Task API.

- Connects to an upstream Task API (e.g. the HDR UK Cohort Discovery Tool).
- Fetches tasks.
- Queues them for one or more downstream sub nodes (e.g. [Bunny][bunny-repo] instances).
- Accepts task results from the downstream nodes.
- Submits aggregate results to the upstream Task API.

Implements a subset of the Task API for the downstream nodes to interact with.
